# What is it?

A simple set of React components that create the basic pattern for a QEWD.js/React Bootstrap/WebSocket
application, based around the UI look and feel used by the QEWD-Monitor application.

It includes:

- everything needed to initialise and register your QEWD.js back-end session
- a customisable banner (allowing you to define your own Nav options)
- a customisable login modal panel
- a logout Nav option
- a main content panel, which provides the starting point for your own application

The benefit is that using this scaffold cuts out the main work in creating the framework and
lead-in for your applications (assuming you're happy with the UI look and feel).


# How to Install

## Quick Worked Example (on a new Ubuntu 16.04 system)

### Install QEWD.js + YottaDB database (if you haven't already done so):

        cd ~
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robtweed/qewd/master/installers/install_yottadb.sh
        source install_yottadb.sh

### Clone the qewd-react-scaffold Github repo

        cd ~
        git clone https://github.com/robtweed/qewd-react-scaffold

### Create new QEWD application directory

        cd qewd/www
        mkdir testapp
        cd testapp

### Copy the scaffold files into the right locations

        cp ~/qewd-react-scaffold/www/* .
        cp ~/qewd-react-scaffold/example/app.js .
        cp ~/qewd-react-scaffold/example/TestContent.js .
        cp ~/qewd-react-scaffold/example/testApp.js ~/qewd/node_modules/testApp.js

## Notes

The app.js file defines the configuration for your particular application.  Edit the example version 
to meet your needs

In the app.js example you'll see this section:

      navs: [
        {
          text: 'Main',
          eventKey: 'main',
          default: true,  // default=true to make this display by default
          panel: {
            title: 'This is the Main Panel',
            bsStyle: 'warning',
            contentComponent: require('./TestContent')
          }
        }, ...etc

This adds a Nav to the banner with the text "Main" and makes it the default main panel to appear after a successful login.  The contents of the panel are defined by a React component named TestContent (the name of the module is up to you).  In the /example directory you'll see a simple version of this TestContent.js component - it simply creates a grid display with 3 empty columns.  If you followed the commands above, that file should now be in your *testapp* directory.

You build out your application from this content component and via any other Navs that you want to define.

# Additional Stuff you'll Need

You'll need to be able to compile your application's components into a single bundle.js file.  See
[this presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/robtweed/ewd-3-training-course-part-37-building-a-reactjs-application-with-ewdxpress-part-4)

In summary, you'll need to do the following to install the necessary React source and build stuff:

- You'll need to have installed QEWD.js of course
- Do the following:

        cd ~/qewd
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robtweed/qewd/master/installers/reactEnvironment.sh
        source reactEnvironemt.sh

To bundle your application:

        cd ~/qewd/www/myNewApp
        browserify -o bundle.js -t [ babelify --presets [ @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react ] --plugins [ @babel/plugin-transform-classes ] ] app.js

You should now see bundle.js in the ~/qewd/www/myNewApp folder

Try the application out in your browser:

        http://192.168.1.100:8080/myNewApp/index.html

        Note: Change the IP address and port to match your QEWD.js setup.

Login with any username.  For the password, use your QEWD.js management password, eg *keepThisSecret!*

Note: when developing out your application, every time you make a change to your components, you must re-bundle using the *browserify* command above.
